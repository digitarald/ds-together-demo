# Data Science Collaboration

*Created for demo purposes*.

This repo contains a collection of resources for data science collaboration. The goal is to provide a set of resources that can be used to help aspiring data scientists collaborate with each other and with other stakeholders.

## Best Practices

For data science collaboration, the following best practices are recommended:

- **Use a version control system** to track changes to code and data.
- **Review code and data changes** using a pull request (PR) process.
- **Test for statistical significance** and practical significance.
- **Summarize insights** and findings in a report for future reference.

## How to Collaborate

Create PRs for review, both for drafts and for final versions. This will allow for comments and suggestions to be made inline with the text.
